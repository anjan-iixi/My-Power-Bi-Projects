## Problem Statement

Businesses often face a lack of clear visibility into mobile sales performance. It can be challenging to track which regions are driving the most sales, how various payment methods contribute to revenue, or how current sales compare to previous periods.

Without a consolidated view of these metrics and trends, decision-makers lack the data-driven insights needed for effective sales planning and marketing. The Mobile Sales Dashboard addresses this problem by consolidating sales data into interactive visualizations, empowering decision-makers with actionable insights.
