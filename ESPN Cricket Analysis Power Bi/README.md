## 📌 Project Overview

Cricket is not just about runs and wickets — it’s about performance patterns, consistency, and game-changing moments.
In this project, I collected this data from **ESPN Cricket** (India vs South Africa ODI Series) and built an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.

The dashboard is divided into **3 key sections**:

🏏 **Batting Performance:** Runs, Strike Rate, Boundaries, Highest Score

🎯 **Bowling Performance:** Wickets, Economy Rate, Bowling Average, Best Bowling Innings

🧤 **Fielding Performance:** Catches, Number of Stumpings, Dismissals per Innings

Additionally, it includes match-level **comparisons, timelines, and overall insights**.
